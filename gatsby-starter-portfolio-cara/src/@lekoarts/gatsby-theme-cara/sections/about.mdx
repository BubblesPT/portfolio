## About me


#### Martim Fernandes dos Santos, 24 years old Web developer student


I was born in Portugal but an opportunity was given to me to come to France and chase my dream to study Web development.
I'm currently studying at Epitech - Nancy since November 2019, I've been learning different languages but the ones that
stood out the one that stood out the most for me was PHP. I had to go through the rough part of learning a new foreign
language as well as computer languages but I think I managed to work both of them.

My previous working experiences were not in the computer field but I did manage to grasp some basic knowledge that I
believe will be helpful for me in the future. When I worked as a clerk in a home appliances shop, I learned how to
speak with clients and how to work in a team, the most important thing is communication and I've been trying to improve
the way that I communicate with colleagues and other people in general.


I really enjoy playing guitar, reading books (fantasy books to be precise) and playing computer games in my spare time.
